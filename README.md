Raleigh Vibes

This website is meant for anyone in the Raleigh area, looking to experience new music and events! With this site you can check out a video of each event before buying the tickets. This allows users to find new events and experiences that they not have heard of before. 

For Raleigh natives this site is great to buy last minute tickets and for those coming for a visit feel free to change the dates so you can plan your trip in advance. 

**This site uses Ticketmaster's API and may require users to make a ticketmaster account to buy tickets.**
